# introduction_to_GAN
The aim of the project was to implement a basic GAN in order to create images similar to the MNIST dataset.

The project is divided into 4 parts

1- We prepare the data

2- we build the generator

3- we build the discriminator

4- we train the model

My computer was not powerful enough to have correct results but we still see an improvement in the model at then.

I based my work on Nicholas Renotte youtube video and I want to thank him for his help to understand how GAN work.
